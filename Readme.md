# Kickstarter With Blockchain

**This app is aimed to solve the fraudulent activities that have been carried out by some people at Kickstarter with the supporter's money**

### Properties

- A manager chooses to gather crowdfunding for his/her idea

- It's been pitched with a **Minimum Contributor Amount** i.e. less that this amount won't be accepted

- This entire money is stored in a smart contract and won't be directly sent to the manager

- Manager can create spending request for spending the gathered money. But, that request will be only accepted when the manager gets a majority voting from the crowd-funders otherwise, adiós to your request
